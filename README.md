### Xyris Build Container

This container includes all of the tools necessary to build the Xyris kernel, documentation, and boot image. Occasionally updated to include new tools or update current tools to the latest version.

It is **highly** recommended that [scuba](https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/scuba) is installed when using this container.
